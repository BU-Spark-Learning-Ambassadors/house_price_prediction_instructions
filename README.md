**Boston Housing Price Prediction Challenge**

**What is a micro-challenge?**
A micro-challenge is a focused task or project that can be completed within a relatively short time frame, designed to be innovative and foster learning. These challenges cater to varying skill levels, ensuring inclusivity for beginners to more experienced individuals. Typically, a micro-challenge can be completed within a couple of hours to two days.

**Difficulty**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

**What you will build:**
In this micro-challenge, you will develop and compare two machine learning models - Decision Tree and Random Forest - to predict Boston house prices. Using the Boston house prices dataset, you'll load and preprocess the data, train both models, and evaluate their performances to identify which model more accurately predicts house prices.

**How you will build it:**

Environment Setup: Utilize tools such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any other Python programming environment.
Data Handling: Load the Boston house prices dataset, explore and visualize correlations.
Model Training and Tuning: Implement Decision Tree and Random Forest models, tune their parameters.
Performance Evaluation: Compare both models based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
Duration: 3 Hours

**Instructions**

**üöÄ Setup**
Choose and set up your Python programming environment (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).
Load the Boston house prices dataset.
Perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset. Visualize correlations using a heatmap or similar plot.
Prepare the data by splitting it into features (input) and target (output), then into training and testing sets.
Experiment with tuning the parameters for both Decision Tree and Random Forest models to improve performance.

**üèÜ Challenge**
Implement and compare the performance of Decision Tree and Random Forest regression models on the dataset.
Identify key predictors of house prices in Boston and analyze the models' sensitivity to different features.
Evaluate the models based on accuracy, mean squared error, or any other relevant metrics to determine the superior model.
